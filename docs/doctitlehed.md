# Document Names, Topic Titles, and Section Headings

Be succinct and descriptive. Titles should include a product name to quickly orient a user arriving from
a search. Clear and consistent headings help users locate information quickly.

Best practices

* Avoid content-free terms such as *Guide*. 
* Use a descriptive verb such as *Using* or *Configuring*.
* Write using words that are short, descriptive, and specific.
* Promote what a user can do with the product. Don't use titles and headings that describe a feature.
* Avoid vague phrases such as *Other*, *Miscellaneous*, *Introduction*, or *Before You Begin*.

You can also use a noun that describes the content, such as *Release Notes* or *Known Issues*.

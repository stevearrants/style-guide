# Second Person
Our documentation often asks the reader to do something or take some action. Use the second person singular
whenever you can.

- You can import a JSON file and edit its settings.
- Find out how you can speed up your work with Data Loader.

If you create content for multiple users address the primary user as *you* and refer to the other users by their
role or titles.

- As an Administrator, you can adjust the settings for Team Members in your Admin panel.

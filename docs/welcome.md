# Welcome
The Jitterbit Writing Style Guide is the writing style reference for Jitterbit documentation. It is for anyone who
creates customer-facing content. Use it when you develop content for
Jitterbit documentation or write UI text for a Jitterbit product.

The Jitterbit Writing Style Guide gives you usage rules, punctuation guidelines, text formatting guidance, and more:

* Terms to use and avoid
* Voice and tone of Jitterbit documents
* The correct way to link to other Jitterbit documents and sites
* The correct way to write about third-party documentation
* Referring to numbers in text
* What to call elements on Jitterbit web sites
* Formatting UI text and other elements in documentation

## It's Only a Guide
All guidelines in the Jitterbit Writing Style Guide are just that: *guidelines*. The goal is to improve Jitterbit
documentation by showing you where and why consistency is important across documents and web sites. Of course, there
are times where it might make sense to move away from these guidelines to make your documentation
better. It's most important that you strive for clear, high-quality documentation than to blindly follow this guide.
If you make a decision to not follow our guidance, please send us an <a href="mailto:docs@jitterbit.com?subject=Style Guide" target="_blank">email</a> or put a Slack message
in the #documentation channel letting us know what you decided and why. We may incorporate your changes
into this guide.

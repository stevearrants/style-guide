# Pronouns
Pronouns replace nouns. When you use pronouns in your writing, make sure that the pronoun correctly refers to the
*antecedent*, the noun it replaces.

## Gender-neutral pronouns
Be inclusive and don't make assumptions about sex or gender. When you write Jitterbit documentation, avoid using
gender-specific and sexist language.

Most of the topics in our documentation use the second-person singular pronoun, *you* and *your*, to address a
single user directly. If you have to write in the third person or refer to someone in the third person, make
sure that you choose gender-neutral third-person pronouns, such as *they*, *their*, and *them*.

It's acceptable to use a plural pronoun with a singular antecedent when you refer to people. Use
third-person-plural pronouns when you refer to a person of unspecified gender. Don't write *him or her* or
*his or hers*.


## Personal pronouns
Use the second-person pronoun, *you*. Avoid first-person pronouns, such as *I*, *our*, *us*, and *we*. They're
acceptable when you respond directly to a user in email or another response.

## Relative pronouns
*That* and *which* don't mean the same thing, so don't use them interchangeably.

In a sentence, *that* introduces an essential clause. If you remove  *that* and the clause that follows,
the sentence doesn't make sense.

### Correct
- For the directory, provide the path that you want Design Studio to use as a working directory.

*Which* introduces a nonessential clause. If you remove *which* and the clause that follows, the sentence
still makes sense, although it is less detailed.

### Correct
- Cloud Studio uses the `jitterbit.conf` file, which is essential for proper operation.

When referring to a person, use *who* instead of *that*.

## Vague pronouns
Avoid ambiguous references between a pronoun and its antecedent. Vague pronouns include *this*, *that*,
*which*, and *it*. Replace the vague pronoun with a noun to assure clarity.

### Correct
- Set `WritetoFile` to true.
### Incorrect
- Set it to true.

# Tone
The way most people speak and the way they write is often very different. When we're not technical, we're informal
and colloquial. Traditionally, technical writing is formal, dry, and exact. At Jitterbit we strive to balance that
is casual and informal, but also direct and approachable.

When you create written content, write for the user's needs. Think of the user as a work acquaintance that you are
trying shape your docs around your reader's needs and expectations, and write to them as though they are a
professional acquaintance. Make your writing confident, friendly, and comprehensive.

Here are a few guidelines you can follow to achieve a balanced tone in your writing:

* Stay away from jargon or idioms. See [Use Plain Language](plainlanguage.md).
* Write in active voice and present tense whenever possible. See [Be Active and Present](activepresent.md).
* Use contractions, such as isn't, don't, and can't. See [Contractions](contractions.md).
* Don't use words or phrases such as "Simply choose your...." or "You can easily change your settings....".
  What's simple or easy for one might be a frustrating challenge for another.

# Active Voice
Active voice makes your writing concise, direct, and engaging. It also helps the reader identify the subject of the  
sentence. In the following example, the person who submits the form is essential information. Omitting that leads\to
a confusing and impersonal sentence.

- Passive: The change to the activity must be saved before exiting
- Active: You must save the activity before you exit.

The passive almost always results in a longer sentence. Passive voice de-emphasizes who should take an action.  
Wordy instructions are also harder to follow.

- Passive: The log must be saved on your system, as it will be required for future inquiries.
- Active: Save the log on your system for later use.

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.

##  How to recognize the passive voice
Use of the passive voice is common enough that many people don't notice when they use it. Here's a simple way to  
recognize it. If you insert *by zombies* after the verb and the sentence still makes sense, you're using the  
passive voice.

- The form was submitted by zombies.
- Cloud Studio notifies you when the operation was validated by zombies.

##  When to use the passive voice
There are always exceptions. Don't use the passive voice in a way that makes actions seem like they happen without  
anyone doing them. Good documentation should always make it clear who or what is doing something.

You may need to use the passive voice with error messages or make something easier to understand.

Rewording any of these sentences to use the active voice would complicate the sentence or pull focus away  
from its main point:
- Responses sent from JIRA the activity include **Success** or **Error**.
- Jitterbit Support is required to respond to requests within 4 working hours.
- The system was put into an error state by the transformation.

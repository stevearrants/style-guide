# Contractions
Jitterbit documentation is informal in tone, so you can use contractions in the present tense, such  
as *isn't*, *don't*, and *can't*.

Sometimes rewriting a sentence in the future-tense into the present tense is awkward or sounds stilted. It's  
okay to use contractions, such as *won't*. For more on tenses, [Present Tense](present.md).

Avoid using contractions formed from nouns and verbs to show possession, such as *the operation's*. See
[Possessives](possessives.md) for guidance.

# Writing a Procedure

Here are some rules of thumb for writing effective procedures.

* Each action is a numbered step. Results do not take a number as they are not a step.
* If there is only one step, don't use a bullet or a number.
* Use active voice. It is easier to understand.
* Use second person. You're talking to the user, so second person is best. You can even use the word *You* in your instructions (like I just did).
* Present tense, please. Most of the time  users read the instructions when they're in the middle of trying to do something
or solve a problem.
* Try to write no more than 8 steps. If you require more, break the procedure up into a grouped set of procedures.
* Include images and videos if they help the user.
* Use sub-steps sparingly, and use bullets or a, b, c, etc., but be consistent.
* Don't use *Input* to show typing information. Use *Enter* instead.

## Prerequisites

Give the user prerequisites needed to start or complete a procedure. For example, if the user needs a working 
Salesforce account, tell him. By giving prerequisites, you're setting the user up to succeed. By
avoiding frustration,
you're building the user's confidence and establishing your authority.

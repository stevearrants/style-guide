# Present Tense

In technical writing, present tense is easier to read and understand than past or future tense. It lets the user
experience the procedure or learning while reading it. Minimize past and future tense in your writing. Simple verbs
are easier to understand than complex verbs, such as those in the progressive or perfect tense.

Especially for procedures, think of the user as they follow the steps. They're *in the now*.

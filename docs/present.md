# Present Tense

In technical writing, present tense is easier to read and understand than past or future tense. It lets the user
experience the procedure or learning while reading it. Minimize past and future tense in your writing. Simple verbs
are easier to understand than complex verbs, such as those in the progressive or perfect tense.

Especially for procedures, think of the user as they follow the steps. They're in the moment.

Use these:

- Click **Open**. Data Loader displays the file contents.
- Cloud Studio warns you of errors as you work.
- As you work, Cloud Studio warns you of potential errors.

Instead of these:

- Click the **Save** icon. Data Loader will save your changes.
- While working, Cloud Studio will warn you if you have made an error.
- When you click **Submit**, Cloud Studio will validate and save your work before continuing.

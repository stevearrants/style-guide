# Capitalization

Follow the capitalization guidelines in <a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html" target="_blank">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>. Some guidelines are specific to our documentation:

* See the [Jitterbit Terminology Glossary](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) for the
correct capitalization of Jitterbit terms.
* Don't use capitalization for emphasis.

The types of capitalization styles referenced are as follows:

## Titles and Heading
* Use title case. For example, **Component Dependencies, Deletion, and Removal**.
* Don't capitalize articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor), the "to" in an infinitive, and prepositions (with, to, for, in, from).
* For hyphenated words, capitalize the first element and the subsequent elements unless they are
articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions.

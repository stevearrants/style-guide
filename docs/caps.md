# Capitalization

Follow the capitalization guidelines in [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). 

There are some Jitterbit-specific guidelines, however. 
- Never capitalize to emphasize text. 
- The correct form for Jitterbit terms are in the [Usage dictionary](usagedict.md).

## Title Case
Use title case for names, titles, and headings.

### Capitalize
- The first word in a heading
- Nouns
- Pronouns
- Verbs
- Adjectives
- Adverbs
- Subordinating conjunctions (*if*, *because*, *as*, *that*, and so on).
- The first element and subsequent elements in hyphenated words (*Command-Line*).
### Don't capitalize
- Articles (*a*, *an*, *the*)
- Coordinating conjunctions (*and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*)
- *to* in an infinitive
- Prepositions (*with*, *to*, *for*, *in*, *from*).

## Brands and Companies
Follow the official names for companies, software, services, and terms defined by companies and open source communities. Never modify the capitalization of a trademarked term.

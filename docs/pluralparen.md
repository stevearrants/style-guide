# Plurals in Parentheses
Avoid using a lowercase *s* or *es* in parentheses &ndash; *(s)* or *(es)* &ndash; after a noun to indicate both
singular and plural. Choose the best option for your document. In most cases, using the plural works
best for understanding the sentence.

If it's important to include both singular and plural, trying including the phrase *one or more*.

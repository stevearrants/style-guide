# Use `alt-text` with Images

Some of our users rely on screen reader software to read our documentation. Screen readers convert the contents on a
page into speech. All images in our documentation must have `alt-text` so the entire page is accessible through
screen reader software. This text is a written-out description of the image that a screen reader can dictate.

You can find more information about website accessibility requirements on the
[Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) website and on the
[Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) website. See also [Write for All Users](everyone.md).

#### Note
It is becoming more common that requirements or sales quotes require accessibility statements.
 
##  Best practices
All images &mdash; screenshot, diagram, GIF, or inline image &mdash; must have alt text. For inline images, GIFs,
and complex diagrams, include adequate surrounding text so you don't place too much information in the `alt-text`.

###  Surrounding text
 For an inline image, write the name or a description of the icon in the sentence. Put the icon inparentheses
 immediately after that text. For a complex diagram, use lines of surrounding text to explain the diagram. You can  
 include a simple sentence in the `alt-text` that refers to this descriptive text. Use a complete sentence to lead
 into the image, using a colon as punctuation.

 ### Alt text  
 When you're writing alt text for an image:

- Describe the meaning of the image rather than what you see.
- Introduce only relevant information.
- Don't call out implications or add new information to the alt text.
- For complex images, place the most important information about the image in the first sentence of alt text.
- If the surrounding text describes the image, add a second sentence of alt text that describes where the
  surrounding text is on that page. If the surrounding text doesn't describe the image, you can use multiple
  sentences of alt text to describe the image.

## Alt text examples
Here are some examples of good usage.

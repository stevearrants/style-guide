# Brackets

Jitterbit documentation uses three types of brackets: angle brackets, curly braces, and square brackets.

## Angle brackets (< and >)
Use angle brackets as placeholders for text for user input.

Correct: 
> Type the address in this format: https://<user-specified domain>.example.com.

Angle brackets also indicate UI navigation. See the following example:

> Click **Format > Bold**.

## Curly braces ( { and } )
Use these when they are part of code samples, strings, or other examples.

## Square brackets ( [ and ] )
Use square brackets in a `.conf` file section name.
> In the `jitterbit.conf` file, go to `[Settings]` and set `EnableLocalFileLocation` to `false`.

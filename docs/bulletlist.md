# List Types

Here are guidelines for bulleted lists and numbered lists.

When the order of items isn't important, use an unordered or bulleted list. Alphabetize or use another order, but carry the consistency over to other lists. For example, Cloud Studio lists a connector's activity in a specific order.

Bulleted lists should have:

* A complete lead-in sentence with a colon 
* More than one list item
* Up to two levels of lists
* Parallel sentence construction
* One idea for each list item
* A period or other punctuation if the list items are complete sentences


Here is an example of a bulleted list:  
The following example of a bulleted list contains a complete lead-in sentence. Each item in the list uses parallel construction and doesn't contain more than one phrase.

In addition, users with an expired subscription have these permissions:
* View the list of projects from the project index.
* Open projects to view within the project designer.
* View proje
ct and component configuration screens (for example, connection/activity, transformation, script).

# Image Types

We use these type of images in Jitterbit documentation:

* Product screenshots
* Conceptual and workflow diagrams
* GIFs illustrating a process
* Inline images or UI elements.

## Product Screenshots
Use screenshots for task information. They're also useful in troubleshooting topics.

See the following example of a screenshot:

## Conceptual and Workflow Diagrams
Use diagrams show complex system architecture, workflows, Jitterbit processes, and transformation types. While they should never replace
text, they are an effective way to help users understand complex material.

See the following example of a diagram:


## GIFs Illustrating a Process
You can use an animated GIF to show a process, such as creating a Cloud Studio activity. They're and effective way of enhancing a
text discription.

We use inline images to show what a UI element, such as an icon, button, or command element.

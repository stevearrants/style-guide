# Best Practices: Links

Links are used as cross-references and guide the user through our documentation and web sites. Good links give the user quick access
to relevant related material but don't take the focus away. Remember that users often don't read sequentially. Don't expect users
to read topics sequentially or use the sidebar for navigation. If a link to a related topic adds value, use it.

Before adding links into your content, consider these best practices:

* Never add links to headings or the first paragraph of a topic.
* Critical information belongs in the topic. Don't make the user navigate away to read it.
* Weigh the costs and benefits of the user navigating away to read the linked topics.
* Always give context and let the reader device whether to click or stay in the topic.
* Open links in a new tab.

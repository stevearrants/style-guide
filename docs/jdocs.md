# About Jitterbit Documents
We produce a lot of different documents at Jitterbit. The Jitterbit user documentation set
includes step-by-step instructions, conceptual content, enablement information,
references, troubleshooting pages, and product tutorials.

Every page and every topic must have a clear focus on the user. By providing relevant
information that guides a reader, our documents help users become
productive and confident when they use our software and services.

To support this goal, Jitterbit documentation follows these principles:

* Focus on the user, not on the product or a feature.
* Include only the information a user needs to accomplish their goal.
* Write in direct, plain language.
* Include clear, complete, and rich examples that help users understand complicated concepts
or complex procedures.

## Jitterbit Documents Are User-focused
Readers look for content that applies to their situation, so Jitterbit documents avoid
describing what the product or UI *does* and instead focus on what the user can *do*.

Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents user-focused:

* Consider assumptions about the audience's knowledge level. Write documentation at the level
of understanding the user has, but don't assume that terms and concepts are commonplace.
* Construct sentences that explain *what the user can do* with the product, not what the
product *lets the user do*.
* Consider the user's reason for using the documentation and focus the documentation on their
goal rather than detailing every aspect of what engineering built.

## Jitterbit Documents Are Goal-oriented
As proud and excited as we are about the capabilities of Jitterbit, readers are more interested
in achieving a goal. We show a user how to complete goals and solve real-world problems.

Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents goal-oriented:

* Identify the audience and know their needs before planning content.
* Describe prerequisites and background or other information about the feature that a user
needs to achieve their goal.
* Include just the information that offers value to the user in achieving what they set out
to do. Link thoughtfully to supporting material or additional information.

## Jitterbit Documents Are Straightforward
Users don't read documentation from start to finish. They look for titles and keywords matching
their problem or question. They scan content for information or examples.
Jitterbit documentation has descriptive titles and tasks written in straightforward, plain
language.

Apply the following guidelines to help keep our documentation straightforward:

* Title your topics and section headings so that users can find the information they need.
* Write directly to the user and in plain language. Avoid unnecessary technical language.
* Don't use jargon. Remember that people all around the world read and depend on our documents.
Their experience with English varies.

titles, see [Document Names, Topic Titles, and Section Headings](doctitlehed.md).

## Jitterbit Documents Are Rich in Examples
Users look for examples that illustrate new concepts or complex procedures. Look for use cases
and examples provided by Engineering and Product.

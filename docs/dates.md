# Dates and Time

When writing about dates and times that appear in a Jitterbit product US, duplicate the date format exactly as the UI displays.

## Dates

Use numerals for numbers associated with dates, even if the number is less than 10. Spell out the day of the week and
the month. Don't use ordinals, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on. Here are some examples:

* March 28
* Monday, March 30
* Tuesday, March 31, 2020
* July 2020
* 03-11-2020

### APAC and EMEA Dates

When writing Release Notes or specific content for APAC and EMEA, use the DD-MM-YYYY format. If you are just using digits,
use the YYYY-MM-DD format. For example:
* 28 March 2020
* Monday, 30 March
* Tuesday, 31 March 2020
* 2020-03-11


## Time

Always use a numeral for numbers associated with time. For example:

* Logs are removed very 5 hours.
* You can change the default setting from 5 minutes to 120 minutes.
* Our hours are 8:00 am to 5:00 am, Pacific time.

Use 12-hour time for NA. 

### APAC and EMEA Time
Use the 24-hour clock for time. For example:
> The Production Cloud Agent Group is scheduled to be upgraded in the APAC region from 2020-03-11 13:00 UTC through 2020-03-11 19:00 UTC
> (We
dnesday, March 11, 2020 from 6:00 am through 12 noon PDT).

**NOTE:** Pay close attention to Standard and Daylight Saving Time changes in North America when reporting time.

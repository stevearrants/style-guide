# Links

We use links to topics within our documentation, links to downloads, and links to third-party sites.

## Within Our Documentation

Follow these guidelines when linking to Jitterbit documentation:
* Use *See* to introduce a link in the sentence and always use the full topic title for the link.
* Don't use quotation marks, bold, or other formatting in the link text.

* Punctuation that isn't part of the title does not belong in the link.

Correct: To add additional roles, you can create custom roles. See Create a custom role.

## Links to Downloads

of the link. You don't need to  include an extension unless you are linking to a speficic file.

Examples:

## Links Third-Party Sites

Avoid creating deep links to specific pages outside of Jitterbit website. Instead, link to the main topic or document. For example,
> Information on Snowflake stored procedures is available from Snowflake at [Stored Procedures](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/stored-procedures.html)
> and [Stored Procedure Management & Usage](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/ddl-udf.html#stored-procedure-management-usage).

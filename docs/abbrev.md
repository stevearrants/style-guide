# Abbreviations

Don't use common abbreviations, such as a.k.a., e.g., etc., and i.e., in documentation and UI text. They may not be
familiar to nonnative speakers. Instead, use precise language and state what you mean. See the
[Usage dictionary](usagedict.md) for terms to use in place of abbreviations.

Write abbreviations for keyboard shortcuts using initial capitalization, plus ( + ) signs, no spaces, and no periods.

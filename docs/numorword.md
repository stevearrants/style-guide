# Numerals or Words?

When writing about numbers that appear in a UI, always duplicate them exactly as the UI displays.
That's what the user is looking for in the documentation.

Spell out numbers from zero to nine, but use the numeral if the number is 10 or greater. Use a comma in a number that has four or more
digits except for years or in code.

Here are some examples:

* Because our servers are distibuted, we offer zero downtime.
* This Cloud Studio project has 10 separate workflows.
* The maximum size for the data file is 10,204 GB.
* The NA release is planned for March 10, 2020.

### Be Consistent
If you use a single-digit number in a sentence with another number that is 10 or greater, then use numerals for all
numbers in that sentence. For example:

* From the 14 results, select 5 to use in the activity.
* The CPU activity will be between 5% and 20%.
* We recomment a 4-core CPU with 16 MB memory.

### Never Start a Sentence with a Numeral
Rewrite the sentence so the number is prefaced by a modifier or appears later later in the sentence. If rewriting is impossible, then spell out the number at the beginning of the sentence.

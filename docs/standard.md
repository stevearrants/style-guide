# Standard English Spelling and Phrases

Write in standard English. We use the ??? dictionary, so consult the dictionary if you question your spelling.

Avoid Latin and British abbreviations, spelling, and phrases, such as *e.g.*, *colour*, and *full stop*.  
The [Usage dictionary](usagedict.md) has acceptable terms to use instead.

# Use Plain Language
Using plain language helps the widest variety of users understand what you write. Remember that Jitterbit serves aglobal audience whose first language might not be English. Plain language makes translation easier and makes documentation more accessible. Using plain language increases the chance that readers understand what you wrote the first time they read it.

For more guidance on how using plain language increases accessibility, see [Write for Everyone](everyone.md).

Here are some tips for using plain language in your writing:

* Avoid obscure words.
* If you use technical terms or jargon, explain it.
* Use simple sentences. Shorter sentences are easier to understand. Try to have only one idea or concept per sentence.
* Avoid abbreviations. See [Abbreviations](abbrev.md) for more information.
* Be consistent. Use the same term to mean the same thing in one topic as you do in another topic.'
* Use standard Jitterbit terms. Don't use *recipe* if you mean *template*, for example.

## Avoid jargon and complex terminology
Jargon and complex terminology are terms that are specific to a company, software, or service. Technical language  can confuse and frustrate users, so avoid them whenever possible. If you have to use complex or unfamiliar Jitterbit-specific terminology, explain it. Don't expect the user to know and don't make them search for it.

Here are some examples of how to translate jargon into plain language:

**Jargon**|**Plain language**
-----|-----
Do a Snowflake GET.|Use a Snowflake GET activity.
Use Jitterbit's out-of-the-box settings.|Use the default settings.
You can deploy Private Agents on-prem.|You can deploy a Private Agent on-premises.

Use these tips to help you avoid jargon in your writing:

* Keep in mind your audience's level of knowledge.
* Consider if the user needs to know the term to understand the documentation.
* Refer to the [Usage dictionary](usagedict.md) for examples of words and phrases that are unnecessarily complex and their alternatives.

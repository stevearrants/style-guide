# Best Practices: Images

If you have an interface that might be complex or difficult to understand, images can help the user.
A screenshot, workflow diagram, or GIF along with text can describe a process and provide conceptual
information. However, images must supplement written content. It shouldn't replace it.

Images must include additional text to assist users with visual disabilities. For more information on making images accessible, see [Write for All Users](everyone.md).

## When to include an image
Consider using an image in the following circumstances:

The UI requires complex interactions.
You need to orient users to a screen that has many functional parts.
You need to illustrate complex relationships among discrete parts of a product.
You need to diagram or illustrate conceptual information.
You need to illustrate several steps in a complex or intricate process.
There are design problems in the UI or workflow.
Before you create an image
Before you create an image, consider the following approaches:

Consider whether you can use a table or list instead of a screenshot to convey the information you want to capture. For example, you can display forms and search results in a table.
Understand that the information you capture in an image might change in the next release. Consider whether you're willing to update the image every time the UI or process changes and maintain it for every release.
Whenever possible, reuse an existing image instead of creating a new one. Consider whether you can use the same image for multiple steps or procedures.
After you create an image
Once you've placed an image in your documentation, complete the following tasks:

Make sure your images are accurate and up-to-date before release.
Introduce each image with a full sentence that describes its contents.
Always include alt text with an image. See Including alt text.
When to avoid including an image
Avoid the following uses and types of images in your documentation:

Don't include an image to replace or avoid writing an explanation about how to complete a task.
Don't include a screenshot of the UI if the user can follow your written instructions without it. A well-designed UI doesn't need an accompanying screenshot in the documentation.
Don't use photographs in your docs.
Don't include an image if it contains customer data or Splunk data.

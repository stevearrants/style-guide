# Best Practices: Images

We all take pictures of our screen from time to time because it is often the fastest way to show and explain something. Screenshots
are essential for almost any documentation as they can be of great help for users providing quick visual solution.
You have to think about many things when making screenshots, such as image size, image quality, information privacy, text
readability, and more.If you have an interface that might be complex or difficult to understand, images can help the user.

A screenshot, a workflow diagram, or a GIF along with text can describe a process and provide conceptual
information. However, an image must supplement written content. It shouldn't replace it.

Always include additional text to assist users with visual disabilities. For more information on making images accessible, see [Write for All Users](everyone.md).

## When to include an image
Consider using an image in the following circumstances:

* Your UI requires complex interactions in precise order.
* Your product's interface has many related parts.
* You need to show complex relationships.
* There are workflows to compare and contrast..
* There are design problems in the UI or workflow.

## Before you create an image
Consider the following before starting:

* Can you use a table or list instead of a screenshot?. 
* What if the information shown in the image changes in the next release. 
* Is there an existing image you can reuse?

## After you create an image

Use this checklist before publishing:

* Check your images for accuracy before release.
* Introduce each image with a sentence that describes its contents.
* Always include alt-text with an image. See [Including alt-text](alt-text.md).

Other guidelines:

* Images shouldn't replace an explanation about how to complete a task.
* If the user can follow the written instructions without a UI screenshot, don't include it. Well-designed UIs don't 
need screenshots.
* Never include customer data, Jitterbit data, or Protected Health Information (PHI) in an image.

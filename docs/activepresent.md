# Active Voice, Present Tense, Second Person
Strive for active voice and present tense in your documentation. Writing in active voice allows readers to place  
themselves as the subject in the documentation, and present tense tells readers what they can expect as they work
through the topics.

While there are times using passive voice and future tense is appropriate, always keep your audience in mind and center your writing around the user as much as possible.

Active voice
Active voice makes content clear by indicating who or what performs the action, even when the subject is implied. Minimize the use of passive voice in your writing.

How to use this guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

This guide helps writers create content that is both easy to 
understand and meets people where they are. Instead of talking at the 
end user, talk to or with them. Make it your goal to give the user 
actionable, understandable information that meets their needs and doesn't frustrate them.

The suggestions here will help you learn how to collaborate with the audience, invite them into the process, and communicate with them.

Treat this guide as a reference, not a rule book. Use it when you're wondering whether to capitalize the word *submit*, for instance, or 
when you need guidelines on how to create a friendly and useful 
document.

This guide is structured into descriptively named sections. Find the
topic you're looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword.

Adapt it to your own needs. If a section isn't relevant to you, 
ignore it. If there is something missing, add it.

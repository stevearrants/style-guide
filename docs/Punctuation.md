# Punctuation

## Colons
Capitalize the first word after a colon if a colon introduces a direct quotation or the first word after a colon is a
proper noun. For example:

* Search returned one result: **Salesforce**. 
* The activity returns two codes: **Success** or **Error**.

## Semicolons
Use semicolons sparingly. They are difficult to see on some hand-held devices. Semicolons can sometimes confuse non-native
English speakers. For example, in Greek you end a question with a semicolon. In Arabic a semicolon denotes a direct causal
relationship between different phrases. 

Rewrite the sentence or paragraph to make it more readable.

## Commas
Use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction.
For example: 
> Learn about variables, placeholders, and entries.

## Dashes
When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the longer em dash (—) with a space on either side of the dash. For example: 
> We emphasize specific, customer-centered workflows, and — whenever possible — we preserve your current workflow.

Use words rather than symbols, but in some contexts you may use an en dash to convey a range of numbers. For example:
> We assign 2–5 people to each development team.

## Spaces
Sentences should always be separated by a single space. Never two spaces.

Ampersands or plus signs
Use *and* instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they're part of an official title or company name. For example, *Hoefler & Co*.

## Slashes
Avoid using the slash / symbol in text except for code. Replace a slash with words or commas as appropriate.

## Avoid Complex Word 

Shorter words are often more accurate and less ambiguous. Writers sometimes use
long, complex words as a way to distance themselves from the text or as a way of 
sounding authoritative. Unless certain words or phrases are required due 
to regulation or contract, use the shorter, simpler word or phrase.

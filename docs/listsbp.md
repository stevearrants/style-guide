# Best Practices for Lists

Users look for lists because lists organize information in a compact, scannable format.

These tips will help you with creating and using lists in your documents:

* Always introduce a list with a complete lead-in sentence.
* Create lists with more than a single item
* Limit lists to two levels.
* Create the second level lists with more than one item.
* Capitalize the first letter of item.
* Use terminal punctuation if the list item is a complete sentence. If you punctuate one item, punctuate all of them, even those that are not complete sentences.
* Use parallel sentence construction. Start all lists items with verbs.
* Avoid including links in a procedure list.

We use two list types in Jitterbit documentation: bulleted lists and numbered lists.

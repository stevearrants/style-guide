Do not distribute externally. Jitterbit Messaging Terminology Business-to-Business (B2B) Integration : B2B integration refers to the integration, automation, and optimization of business processes that extend outside an organization. Jitterbit connects businesses in industries such as Healthcare, Finance, and Retail by supporting more than 5,000 document standards and 25,000 transaction sets, EDI formats (e.g. X12, EDIFACT, TRADACOMS, XML, CICA, HL7, FHIR), industry-specific formats, and formats with extremely complex file schemas. See customer examples including Matouk and Bounce Energy . Jitterbit also supports modern B2B integration scenarios involving partner enablement through a Hub/ELA Integration Model. Business Process Automation (BPA) / Robotic Process Automation (RPA) : Many customers use the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform to automate their business processes by using iPaaS to trigger actions, tasks, and alerts based on data. Some of them (including Salesforce and Intelliflo) refer to this as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Customers can loosely couple and re-use these services within the Jitterbit Harmony Design Studio to orchestrate business process flows as needed. A good example of this is Salesforce, which uses Jitterbit to automate more than 3,500 internal orchestrations across departments such as Revenue Operations, M&A, and IT. Business Process Management (BPM) : BPM is the discipline of improving a business process from end to end through analysis, improvement, monitoring, and optimization. Jitterbit powers BPM by providing a dedicated tool for backend data flow and integration, enabling a wide range of use cases from automating engineering processes to streamlining approvals and alerts. Jitterbit\u2019s interface is used during the design stage, as well as over time, allowing stakeholders to easily review, refine, and improve processes. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Deployment) (CI/CD) : CI/CD is a software development practice that allows for frequent or immediate deployment of new product changes. This practice requires automation across all development cycles, from building to testing, approving, and releasing. Jitterbit not only facilitates integration with third-party CI/CD apps and toolkits (Jenkins, GitHub, etc.), but also has built-in capabilities, such as migration, deployment, and scheduled operation triggers, that enable customers to use this practice seamlessly without the need for additional tools. Connectivity : Connectivity is the ability of a platform to support native communication protocols supported by the targeted endpoints. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform provides tools to connect, expose, and use your data using almost any format, protocol, and method of communication. Demo : At Jitterbit, a demo is a demonstration of capabilities of the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform with regard to eiPaas and API capabilities germane to a customer\u2019s integration and/or API needs. A demo does not necessarily mean that it was customized with customer requirements. In contrast, see the definition for Proof of Concept (POC) . Endpoints : Endpoints, also known as connections, are systems and applications where data is stored or business logic is located. Jitterbit integrates and synchronizes data between endpoints such as databases, APIs, files, applications, etc. Refer to Endpoint Definitions for the latest on what Jitterbit defines as endpoints. Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) : An ESB is a software architecture used to connect enterprise applications and services so they can communicate with each other. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform is used as as a full-blown integration broker, handing off, merging, and manipulating information on an as-needed basis. Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) : TO COME Hub Model : A Hub model is a flexible licensing model that supports an enterprise\u2019s complex internal and external integrations with its business partners, using a scalable platform to centrally design, deploy, and manage business data workflows across a variety of integration scenarios. Internet of Things (IoT) Integration : The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform supports IoT for batch transfers as well as real-time communication and queueing, including manual acknowledgement messaging and traffic proxying. Customers can provide an API interface for IoT devices to communicate with backend systems and data repositories, using Harmony's scale and performance for high volumes of concurrent requests from various devices. Jitterbit has demonstrated support for Microsoft Azure IoT Suite (Hub) and Salesforce IoT Cloud (see video with Salesforce at Dreamforce). Jitterbit Assurance : Jitterbit Assurance\u2122 refers to Jitterbit\u2019s promise to provide each customer a tailored journey that maximizes value based on the customer\u2019s desired business outcomes. Jitterbit Assurance reflects Jitterbit\u2019s customer-first culture combined with years of integration experience. At the heart of Jitterbit Assurance is a designated, named Customer Success Manager (CSM) responsible for ensuring the customer achieves their business goals. Each customer journey begins with the CSM and customer codifying a multi-phased \u201cSuccess Plan\u201d that links each step of the customer\u2019s journey to the customer\u2019s business outcomes. Success plans are reviewed regularly with the client and Jitterbit executive leadership and are signed off only when the customer\u2019s business outcomes are met (as opposed to when the solution is configured and deployed). The CSM serves as a key escalation point, fully empowered by Jitterbit leadership to engage in real-time all Jitterbit assets and personnel impacting the client experience including Professional Services, Technical Account Management, Support, Operations, Solutions Engineering, and Jitterbit executive leadership to remove any impediment to customer success. Jitterbit TAM Service : The Jitterbit Technical Account Manager (TAM) service offers white-glove attention and proven integration strategy advice to customers and partners interested in maximizing the value of their Jitterbit solution and becoming masters of digital connections. The Jitterbit TAM works hand in hand with customers and partners C-level executives, directors, and program managers in pursuit of the following: Acquiring a systemic perspective of the customer's or partner's integration landscape and its value and impact to the business. Developing a deep understanding of the customer's or partner's integration strategy and short-term and long-term use cases. Advising the customer or partner on integration strategy and architecture best practices as it pertains to the use of Jitterbit technology. Acting as a technical liaison between the customer or partner and Jitterbit to communicate product roadmap; identify and advocate product features that would most rapidly benefit the customer or partner; and provide technical guidance and project reviews. Orchestration : In Jitterbit, an orchestration is made up of the logical steps performed within an operation chain in support of the integration scenario. Consisting of a set of linked operations, an orchestration is the combination of on-success and on-failure flows, as well as any dynamic flows that are triggered by events or payload data. Plan of Record (POR) : A POR is a Jitterbit internal budgeting document, used to manage leads-to-conversion ratios vs. projected revenue. Proof of Concept (POC) : At Jitterbit, a POC is a proof of capabilities of the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform that allows Jitterbit to prove our capabilities to support a customer\u2019s integration and API needs. Usually, a POC is driven by customer-specific requirements and sometimes executed within the customer\u2019s own infrastructure. Jitterbit\u2019s POC approach is a key differentiator that sets us apart from competitors. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) : A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is an evaluation of the underlying cause of a problem. At Jitterbit, we post an RCA to our Trust site ( trust.jitterbit.com ) after any potential outages or significant degradation of service to transparently and openly explain to affected customers what happened, why, and the steps we are taking to prevent the problem from recurring. Note that the same Trust site is also used to communicate non-impacting scheduled events, such as regular releases. Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) : A ROM is a document managed by the Jitterbit Sales Engineering (SE) team that provides a high-level scope of the cost of services attached to a prospect\u2019s project. A ROM is an 80/20 approach to scoping and sizing Jitterbit implementations. It lacks the precision of detailed scoping but offers speed and a path to closing a deal quickly. A ROM looks at the factors that most impact the time and effort associated with particular use cases, including these: Application endpoint Batch or near real time One way or bi-directional Data volumes (1,000s, 10,000s, or >500,000) Data quality (high, medium, or low) Objects involved (price book, accounts, contacts) Jitterbit Integration Personas API Consumer : Jitterbit customers' internal and external users who use the Portals within the Jitterbit Harmony API Manager: Internal API Consumer : A Jitterbit direct customer or a user authorized by the Jitterbit customer (e.g., Jitterbit customer employees or contractors). External API Consumer : A third party that is affiliated with the Jitterbit customer (e.g., Jitterbit customer partners, customers, or vendors). API Publisher : Jitterbit customers (developers) who create APIs and publish Portals using the Jitterbit Harmony API Manager. Citizen Integrator : A Citizen Integrator is typically a Line of Business user, such as a Software as a Service (SaaS) or HR Admin within a department who is responsible for orchestrating simple integration projects between endpoints, with the goal of moving or syncing data between applications. These users use Jitterbit Harmony Citizen Integrator to manage recipes. Technical Business Analyst : A Technical Business Analyst is a Jitterbit Harmony Studio user who authors design configurations that leverage integrations and APIs. Their goal is to create integration projects that move information either in batch or in real-time between applications, seamlessly sharing information between departments within their enterprise and with their external partners. Developer : TO COME Integration Architect : An Integration Architect is a person responsible for designing, identifying integration project requirements and working with stakeholders in the implementation of projects/integration initiatives in a timely manner. Further, they are also responsible for monitoring integration operations within an enterprise and enforcing governance, policies. Their goal is to monitor integration operations as well as any of their hosted and managed Jitterbit assets using the Jitterbit Harmony Management Console. Business Decision Maker : A line of business executive who has the budget to purchase Jitterbit. This person is interested in the best way to solve a business problem, not how the technology works. Technical Gatekeeper : A member of the IT staff who evaluates technical solutions such as Jitterbit. They don\u2019t have the ability to say Yes to a purchase but they do have the ability to say No. Jitterbit Product Terminology Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform Jitterbit Harmony is Jitterbit\u2019s modern, multi-tenant, born-in-the-cloud API integration platform that connects Software as a Service (SaaS), on-premise, cloud, and legacy applications. This platform is known as the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform . The Harmony Portal is the web-based interface where customers access Harmony applications, including API Manager , Citizen Integrator , Data Loader , Management Console , and Studio #zcr99mk3n8ma. The Jitterbit Harmony Portal is accessible at login.jitterbit.com. After logging in, the resulting page with the four app cards is called the Harmony Portal landing page. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform is powered by Jitterbit iPaaS capabilities and consists of these components: Harmony Agents : Harmony Agents do the work at runtime, such as connecting to various endpoint systems, transforming data, etc. Harmony customers can use two types of agents, Cloud Agents (serverless agents) and Private Agents (formerly Local Agents), which can be grouped together in Agent Groups to provide for high availability (active/active) and load balancing of operations across those agents. Cloud Agents : Cloud Agents are hosted by Jitterbit directly and perform all of their work in an event-driven fashion, thereby obviating the need for any setup, configuration, or management that is traditional with \u201calways on\u201d server systems that sit behind applications. Jitterbit Cloud Agents are serverless agents, completely scalable, and ensure that all tasks are allocated and executed in a secure and reliable manner. Cloud Agents are organized into Cloud Agent Groups A Jitterbit Cloud Agent Group consists of a set of Jitterbit Harmony Agents maintained and managed by Jitterbit. This option allows you to run all of your integrations in the cloud with a scalable, multi-tenant, fault-tolerant clustered Agent Group. Two Cloud Agent Groups are available: Production Cloud Agent Group : This group is available with a version of the Jitterbit Harmony Agent that is fully tested and ready for production. Sandbox Cloud Agent Group : This group is always the next version of the Jitterbit Harmony Agent, to which the Production Cloud Agent Group will next be upgraded. Typically, it is the version of the Private Agent included in the latest Harmony Platform release at time of the Sandbox Cloud Agent Group update. Private Agents (formerly Local Agents) : Private Agentsare available as traditional installation packages for various Linux and Windows flavors, and as a Docker image. They are self-hosted by customers either on-premise (i.e. in a local/private data center) or on private or public cloud of their choice, manage directly by the customer\u2019s own IT team. By using Private Agents, you choose where your integration runtime environment operates amd control which network your data travels and resides in. Private Agents are often used by customers who need applications to reside within their firewall, or for users who perform integrations under strict regulatory compliance that forbids data to either travel outside a given geographical boundary or reside in the cloud. Acceptable term variations include: Jitterbit Harmony Cloud Agent Jitterbit Harmony Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Docker Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Linux Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Windows Private Agent Cloud Agent, Private Agent, Docker Private Agent, Linux Private Agent, Windows Private Agent Selection of the agent types determine the Harmony deployment model. Any integration project, including APIs, can be deployed with these models: Cloud (Serverless, Full Cloud, Multi-Tenant) : On the Jitterbit Harmony cloud, where the system and scale is completely managed by Jitterbit. Private (On-Premise, Local) : Either an on-premise server or in a public/private cloud, where the system is self-hosted and/or self-managed. Hybrid : In a hybrid mode, where selected portions of the system are self-managed and the remainder is fully managed by Jitterbit. Harmony API Gateway : The Harmony API Gateway provides security, throttling, and validation of any and every incoming API that users publish via Jitterbit. A gateway can also be installed locally and managed internally, or the client can choose the Cloud API Gateway to bypass having to host or control the gateway at all. Harmony Backend Services : Harmony Backend Services include a notification engine, remote private agent management, and other backend systems and services. Harmony Design Repository : The Harmony Design Repository is a secure and encrypted, centralized collection of integration metadata (projects). The Design Repository provides full automatic restore capability from the Harmony cloud and ensures all Cloud and Private Agents have the most recent version of relevant projects. Harmony Messaging Services : Harmony Messaging Services facilitate communication among various Harmony components, providing a reliable method for routing, tracking, and integration retry mechanisms across customers, projects, and means of integration. Harmony Transaction Logs : Harmony Transaction Logs provide easy debugging capabilities for troubleshooting purposes. These logs can be stored for a configurable period of time either locally or on the cloud located in your geography. The extent of information stored in the logs is configurable and can be specified on a per-event basis. Harmony Management APIs : Harmony Management APIs are Jitterbit\u2019s APIs that allow access to all of Harmony\u2019s functionality via web service calls. Any aspect of the Harmony API Integration Platform can be accessed as an API. Developers can leverage these APIs to complete many of the tasks that are typically accomplished via the Design Studio or Management Console, for example exporting Jitterbit logs to a third-party service. Harmony Management APIs are also referred to as Jitterbit Microservices. Harmony region : Jitterbit uses servers in separate regions for NA (North America) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa/Asia/Australia). The region is tied to a Harmony organization rather than a specific user. This allows a user to be part of multiple organizations in different regions. Related Terms Harmony region : Jitterbit uses servers in separate regions for NA (North America) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa/Asia/Australia). The region is tied to a Harmony organization rather than a specific user. This allows a user to be part of multiple organizations in different regions. Jitterbit Harmony Studio Jitterbit Harmony Design Studio is Jitterbit\u2019s project design platform where you can design, test, and deploy your integration projects. These terms are used in Design Studio: Connectors : Connectors are out-of-the-box Jitterbit products that provide pre-built and reusable connectivity to a specific endpoint, such as Salesforce or NetSuite. Connectors provide a flattened interface to reduce the complexity of interacting directly with an endpoint\u2019s API or data exchange protocols. Connectors are used to take the guesswork out of vendor APIs for faster and easier mapping and integration design. Formula Builder : The Formula Builder is used to enter scripts to enhance and refine your wizard-created data processes. Also see the definition for scripts . Hosted HTTP Endpoints : Hosted HTTP Endpoints are project items that enable operations to be triggered via a URL pointed directly at a particular local server. Hosted HTTP Endpoints are not secured, provide limited visibility and management, do not have built-in load balancing or high availability, and are able to be used only with a Private Agent running the operations. Hosted HTTP Endpoints are deprecated and it is recommended instead to use Jitterbit\u2019s Harmony API Integration Platform. Jitterbit Connect Wizards : Jitterbit Connect Wizards provide a fast, easy route to data transformation through a wizard-based integration tool built directly into Jitterbit. The wizard creates for the user all of the complex, detailed operations and components of a transformation. By stepping through the wizard, users can create an integration project without the need for coding. Jitterbit Connect Salesforce Wizards Jitterbit Connect Standard Wizards Jitterbit Entities : Jitterbit Entities are virtual objects that can be created to describe a structure similar to that of a database table with columns. After the Jitterbit Entity is created, the entity is assigned to the OData API. Jitterpak : A Jitterpak is a single file containing all metadata of a project. Jitterpaks are primarily used for easy local backup/archiving and redistribution of projects. Operations : Operations are project items used to define what your integration should do and when it should be done. There are four core Operation Activity types (Transformation, Script, Archive, and Web Service Call) and a variety of other types (Hosted Web Service, API Entity Operation [OData], XSLT Operation, Connectors). Plugins : Plugins are Jitterbit- or user-provided applications that extend native capabilities of Jitterbit. Plugins can be executed within sources or targets in an operation, or called from within scripts. Jitterbit includes a Plugin SDK to allow customers to wrap any business logic they may have already coded for and not want to reimplement in Jitterbit. Scripts : Scripts, written in the Jitterbit proprietary scripting language (Jitterbit Script) or in JavaScript, provide the flexibility and power to transform data, perform calculations, or perform logic validation beyond simple field mapping. Scripts can be used as steps in an operation or within transformations to apply specified logic or conditions to your data. Source : A source defines properties of the system that Jitterbit connects to and retrieves data from. The system properties vary depending on the type of source you choose. Target : A target defines the properties of the system that Jitterbit needs to connect and post data to. The system properties vary depending on the type of target you choose. Transformation : A transformation refers to the transformation and mapping of data between a source and a target system. Depending on the source and target system selected, the transformation wizard takes the user through a set of steps to define the information required to perform the transformation. Data structures representing both source and target systems are presented in graphical tree structures. Variables : Variables are used to allow for the dynamic configuration of endpoints, to support passing of data between operations, and to enable sophisticated integration logic within transformation scripts. Jitterbit Harmony API Manager Jitterbit Harmony API Manager is Jitterbit\u2019s API management web interface where you can create and publish developer-friendly APIs and perform full API lifecycle management tasks. The general industry term API management, often abbreviated APIM, refers to API management in general. Do not use this acronym to refer to Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager web interface. Always refer to API Manager spelled out fully. Other terms used in API Manager include: API : An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of objects, instructions, methods, and standards that allows one software application to talk to another via web services. For example, when using mobile apps, an API is used to request information from a web-based software application and return the information back to your device. Jitterbit differentiates by enabling users to expose any system as a secure, managed, real-time web (e.g. REST, SOAP, custom, OData) API that can be called and consumed by any other apps. This helps eliminate siloed technology, processes, and people, and enable seamless collaboration across departments, divisions, and teams. API Analytics/Logs : Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager provides predefined and customizable dashboards and reports for user-/application-based consumption and performance including hits per hour, response times per hour, and status code per hour. APIs to pull this data are also available. API Authentication Profiles : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, profiles can be set for Anonymous (no username or password required), Basic Authentication (standard login/password and/or key), or OAuth 2.0 using Google as the Identity Provider (requires membership in authorized domains, a Google Client ID, and a Google Client Secret to be validated to access the API at runtime). Additional security settings for rate limiting, logging/auditing, and trusted IP range limiting are also provided within the profile. API Creation : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, Harmony customers can create Jitterbit APIs leveraging existing integration operations. These Jitterbit APIs are created following REST design practices to provide accessible and consumable APIs for both internal and external developers. Each API is assigned a unique, secure URI/URL and each method (GET, POST, etc.) under it is assigned to a single integration operation. As opposed to the outdated, slow waterfall approach in designing APIs (often confusingly referred to as design-first or design-led APIs), Jitterbit believes in the API creation process, where APIs are created on the fly and can be integrated quickly through agile development process. API Debug Mode : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, debug mode enables full tracing for every request received via an API URL. When enabled, the system retains complete content of each API request and response for up to 24 hours from the time the API call was received and applies to all of the operations triggered by the API. API Gateway : Jitterbit\u2019s API Gateway receives API requests, passes the requests to the Jitterbit Agent and/or backend application, and then passes the response back to the requesting app as needed. The gateway provides authentication, security, throttling, analytics, and validation of any and every API. Our gateway is capable of leveraging Harmony\u2019s integration and transformation engine with the ability to access virtually any backend software and modify the request/response. There are two gateway options: the Jitterbit Cloud Gateway hosted by Jitterbit (backed by AWS), or your own Jitterbit Private Gateway that is installed locally on hardware behind your firewall. API Governance : API governance includes tracking what APIs are deployed, who is calling what APIs, statistics (about APIs, API consumers, and the Developer Portal), what policies should be applied, API versioning, etc. API Management (APIM) : API management includes the tools to create and publish web APIs, an API gateway to receive/process requests, a developer portal to consume APIs, and full API governance. API management is a general industry term, and its acronym (APIM) should not be used to refer to Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager web interface. API Rate Limit : The licensing associated with Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager enforces an overall maximum number of hits across all APIs under the particular organization (client/customer). A separate API rate limit may also be set at the profile- and/or environment-level, enforcing a maximum number of hits that this particular profile can make against all APIs assigned to the profile during a period of one minute. Profile-level rate limiting can effectively be used as user-based rate limiting. Developer Portal : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, Developer Portal is labeled as \u201cPortal.\u201d Portal Manager : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, the Portal Manager provides automatically generated OpenAPI documentation allowing the API developer (API Publisher persona) to manage and publish Custom APIs. Portal : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, the Portal provides internal and external developers (API Consumer persona) access to discover, learn about, interact with, and consume published APIs from a central portal. The API Manager includes the ability to invite API developers/consumers to the Portal (similar to inviting customers to Harmony EiPaaS). This provides security/access control via standard user roles such as internal developers and external developers (customers, partners, vendors, etc.). Jitterbit API : A Jitterbit API is an API created on the Harmony API Integration Platform. In addition to the common use cases for APIs, a Jitterbit API can also be used as a proxy for apps, mobile devices, and websites. Jitterbit APIs are custom-built, showcasing the flexibility of our platform. That is, you can build a secure API by using the EiPaaS platform to bring together disparate systems (legacy apps, databases, SaaS, and Cloud apps) that meet your specific business goals as well as match whatever structure and standard you require; therefore, the API is custom-made for your specific needs. OpenAPI 2.0 API Documentation : Using the Jitterbit API Manager, the request and response structures for each Custom API are automatically generated and exposed via the OpenAPI 2.0 (formerly known as Swagger) format within the Developer Portal at the time the API is published. Using the Developer Portal, the documentation may be edited or enhanced by the publisher to provide additional information to internal and external API consumers. (Note: The auto-generation of OpenAPI docs is not available for OData services at this time.) OpenAPI Specification : The Jitterbit API Manager includes the ability to auto-document published Custom APIs using OpenAPI 2.0 in the Portal Manager. Formerly known as Swagger, the OpenAPI Spec is a documentation specification for REST APIs. Open Data (OData) Protocol : OData is an open protocol that allows the creation and consumption of REST APIs in a simple and standard way. Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager provides the ability to create an OData 2.0 API by assigning a URL to a Jitterbit Entity operation. Certain types of Jitterbit Entities, such as SAP, support read only (GET). Real-time/Evented vs. Near Real-time : Real-time/evented refers to processing the data/request as it comes in, typically without buffer delays, with a response expected to be received within milliseconds or sometimes microseconds. Near real-time refers to the time delay introduced by automated data processing or network transmission between the request and the response. Jitterbit Harmony Citizen Integrator Jitterbit Harmony Citizen Integrator is Jitterbit\u2019s click-and-run web application for non-technical users to quickly customize and deploy integrations using pre-built recipes. The acronym CI should not be used to reference Citizen Integrator. Always use the full term, Citizen Integrator. Jitterbit differentiates our Citizen Integrator product by offering fully-tested recipes that are certified to work on their respective endpoints, in addition to crowd-sourced models. Our certified recipes are canonical versions that use a common \u201cMaster\u201d object model (such as an Account Master, Contact Master, or Product Master) and all endpoints are mapped to the canonical Master. It is easy to take a partial recipe and plug it into the Master, knowing it will automatically work, which saves over 50% of the time of having to perform an end-to-end transformation and mapping for an endpoint. Citizen Integrator includes these capabilities: An interface for recipe designers to create and deploy recipes for their end-users and customers. True no-code, conversational user experience, which leads end-users through a question-based, step-by-step configuration and deployment of recipes. Hundreds of certified and pre-built recipes for CRM, ERP, Marketing, HCM, Field Service, E-Commerce, and other SaaS apps. Platform tools that allow recipe developers and administrators a wide variety of options for recipe development and OEM capabilities. In addition to supporting direct embedding, all Citizen Integrator features are available via REST web services, which allow customers to create UI experiences within their own offering or portal. Recipe integration with Jitterbit Harmony Design Studio. Any integration can be converted to a new recipe and any recipe can be imported into Design Studio to be used as a base for a new custom integration project. Ability to share recipes with specific users or groups. Other terms used in Citizen Integrator include: Citizen Integrator Persona : See the definition under Jitterbit Integration Personas . Recipe : A recipe is a reusable integration template in Citizen Integrator that provides a step-by-step guided experience for non-technical users to execute an integration. Recipes can also be downloaded as Jitterpaks and imported into Design Studio. Templates : Templates are pre-built mappings and workflows for a specific integration need between endpoints. Templates provide a jump start to the integration project so that you don\u2019t have to build everything from scratch. Templates provide the most common field mappings and use cases that most customers need. Installing the template alone will give you a baseline integration between the two systems, for example to synchronize Contacts between Salesforce and NetSuite. However, many businesses have custom fields and unique needs that might require some customizations after the template is installed. For example, your business might want to synchronize a custom Contact field (Nickname) between NetSuite and Salesforce. Note that Jitterpaks are not implicitly considered to be templates, and templates are not considered to be recipes. Jitterbit Harmony Management Console Jitterbit Harmony Management Console is Jitterbit\u2019s web console where you can manage your integration projects and perform administrative functions related to your organization. The Management Console was formerly known as the Web Management Console (WMC). Do not use the acronym WMC. Always refer to Management Console spelled out fully. The pages within the Management Console include: Activities : This page shows the runtime status of operations and the sequence in which a related operation ran, as well as provides the ability to cancel any operation that has not completed. This is one place where all of the basic runtime logs are accessible. Agents : This section allows you the option to set up Private Agents (formerly known as Local Agents) as on-premise runtime servers that execute your integration operations, further configure them, and group Private Agents together so that the work can be automatically load balanced and to ensure high availability. Agents : This page allows you the option to set up Private Agents as on-premise runtime servers that execute your integration operations. Agent Groups : This page allows you to group Private Agents so that each agent behaves consistently with other agents in the group. Agent Groups provide for high availability and load balancing of integration operations across agents within a group when more one agent in an Agent Group is installed. Customizations : This section allows you to customize your Jitterbit integrations with plugins and client-side SSL certificates. Plugins : This page allows you to add and manage Jitterbit standard plugins or custom plugins. Jitterbit standard plugins are designed to be plug-and-play. Customers that are using their own custom plugins are responsible for the security of the custom plugins. Client Certificates : SSL client certificate are used to authenticate Jitterbit with external resources. This page allows you to manage SSL certificates used when connecting to HTTPS source/targets or web services. Downloads : This page provides access to installation files for Private Agents, Data Loader, Design Studio, and certain Design Studio Connectors that don\u2019t already come prepackaged with the Jitterbit Agent. Environments : This page allows you to set up environments in an organization to define and manage the integration project lifecycle. All integration projects deployed to Harmony are deployed to various environments, which can represent a given state of an integration project. For example, a common project lifecycle configuration might have three environments: development, test, and production. Environments can also be used to virtually encapsulate scope, such as Team A vs. Team B. Notifications : This page allows you to configure native platform notifications specific to your organization that trigger when various events occur. For example, you can configure notifications for when an agent is down, when your Harmony password is about to expire, or when a new Private Agent version is available. Organizations : This page provides the ability to define and manage who can participate in integration projects as well as manage overall organization security (such as password complexity, etc.). Jitterbit Harmony supports the ability for a user to have multiple roles in multiple organizations. Projects : This page provides the ability to manage all of your projects across the various stages of their lifecycle. You can import and delete projects, as well as run operations, create and apply a schedule on an operation, manage project backups, edit project variables, and view deploy history. Jitterbit Harmony Data Loader Jitterbit Harmony Data Loader is a free data migration tool that enables Salesforce administrators to quickly and easily automate the import and export of data between flat files, databases, and Salesforce.

Jitterbit connects businesses in industries such as Healthcare, Finance, and Retail by supporting more than 5,000 document standards and 25,000 transaction sets, EDI formats (e.g. X12, EDIFACT, TRADACOMS, XML, CICA, HL7, FHIR), industry-specific formats, and formats with extremely complex file schemas. See customer examples including Matouk and Bounce Energy . Jitterbit also supports modern B2B integration scenarios involving partner enablement through a Hub/ELA Integration Model. Business Process Automation (BPA) / Robotic Process Automation (RPA) : Many customers use the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform to automate their business processes by using iPaaS to trigger actions, tasks, and alerts based on data. Some of them (including Salesforce and Intelliflo) refer to this as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Customers can loosely couple and re-use these services within the Jitterbit Harmony Design Studio to orchestrate business process flows as needed. A good example of this is Salesforce, which uses Jitterbit to automate more than 3,500 internal orchestrations across departments such as Revenue Operations, M&A, and IT. Business Process Management (BPM) : BPM is the discipline of improving a business process from end to end through analysis, improvement, monitoring, and optimization. Jitterbit powers BPM by providing a dedicated tool for backend data flow and integration, enabling a wide range of use cases from automating engineering processes to streamlining approvals and alerts. Jitterbit\u2019s interface is used during the design stage, as well as over time, allowing stakeholders to easily review, refine, and improve processes. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Deployment) (CI/CD) : CI/CD is a software development practice that allows for frequent or immediate deployment of new product changes. This practice requires automation across all development cycles, from building to testing, approving, and releasing. Jitterbit not only facilitates integration with third-party CI/CD apps and toolkits (Jenkins, GitHub, etc.), but also has built-in capabilities, such as migration, deployment, and scheduled operation triggers, that enable customers to use this practice seamlessly without the need for additional tools. Connectivity : Connectivity is the ability of a platform to support native communication protocols supported by the targeted endpoints. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform provides tools to connect, expose, and use your data using almost any format, protocol, and method of communication. Demo : At Jitterbit, a demo is a demonstration of capabilities of the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform with regard to eiPaas and API capabilities germane to a customer\u2019s integration and/or API needs. A demo does not necessarily mean that it was customized with customer requirements. In contrast, see the definition for Proof of Concept (POC) . Endpoints : Endpoints, also known as connections, are systems and applications where data is stored or business logic is located. Jitterbit integrates and synchronizes data between endpoints such as databases, APIs, files, applications, etc. Refer to Endpoint Definitions for the latest on what Jitterbit defines as endpoints. Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) : An ESB is a software architecture used to connect enterprise applications and services so they can communicate with each other. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform is used as as a full-blown integration broker, handing off, merging, and manipulating information on an as-needed basis. Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) : TO COME Hub Model : A Hub model is a flexible licensing model that supports an enterprise\u2019s complex internal and external integrations with its business partners, using a scalable platform to centrally design, deploy, and manage business data workflows across a variety of integration scenarios. Internet of Things (IoT) Integration : The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform supports IoT for batch transfers as well as real-time communication and queueing, including manual acknowledgement messaging and traffic proxying. Customers can provide an API interface for IoT devices to communicate with backend systems and data repositories, using Harmony's scale and performance for high volumes of concurrent requests from various devices. Jitterbit has demonstrated support for Microsoft Azure IoT Suite (Hub) and Salesforce IoT Cloud (see video with Salesforce at Dreamforce). Jitterbit Assurance : Jitterbit Assurance\u2122 refers to Jitterbit\u2019s promise to provide each customer a tailored journey that maximizes value based on the customer\u2019s desired business outcomes. Jitterbit Assurance reflects Jitterbit\u2019s customer-first culture combined with years of integration experience. At the heart of Jitterbit Assurance is a designated, named Customer Success Manager (CSM) responsible for ensuring the customer achieves their business goals. Each customer journey begins with the CSM and customer codifying a multi-phased \u201cSuccess Plan\u201d that links each step of the customer\u2019s journey to the customer\u2019s business outcomes. Success plans are reviewed regularly with the client and Jitterbit executive leadership and are signed off only when the customer\u2019s business outcomes are met (as opposed to when the solution is configured and deployed). The CSM serves as a key escalation point, fully empowered by Jitterbit leadership to engage in real-time all Jitterbit assets and personnel impacting the client experience including Professional Services, Technical Account Management, Support, Operations, Solutions Engineering, and Jitterbit executive leadership to remove any impediment to customer success. Jitterbit TAM Service : The Jitterbit Technical Account Manager (TAM) service offers white-glove attention and proven integration strategy advice to customers and partners interested in maximizing the value of their Jitterbit solution and becoming masters of digital connections. The Jitterbit TAM works hand in hand with customers and partners C-level executives, directors, and program managers in pursuit of the following: Acquiring a systemic perspective of the customer's or partner's integration landscape and its value and impact to the business. Developing a deep understanding of the customer's or partner's integration strategy and short-term and long-term use cases. Advising the customer or partner on integration strategy and architecture best practices as it pertains to the use of Jitterbit technology. Acting as a technical liaison between the customer or partner and Jitterbit to communicate product roadmap; identify and advocate product features that would most rapidly benefit the customer or partner; and provide technical guidance and project reviews. Orchestration : In Jitterbit, an orchestration is made up of the logical steps performed within an operation chain in support of the integration scenario. Consisting of a set of linked operations, an orchestration is the combination of on-success and on-failure flows, as well as any dynamic flows that are triggered by events or payload data. Plan of Record (POR) : A POR is a Jitterbit internal budgeting document, used to manage leads-to-conversion ratios vs. projected revenue. Proof of Concept (POC) : At Jitterbit, a POC is a proof of capabilities of the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform that allows Jitterbit to prove our capabilities to support a customer\u2019s integration and API needs. Usually, a POC is driven by customer-specific requirements and sometimes executed within the customer\u2019s own infrastructure. Jitterbit\u2019s POC approach is a key differentiator that sets us apart from competitors. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) : A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is an evaluation of the underlying cause of a problem. At Jitterbit, we post an RCA to our Trust site ( trust.jitterbit.com ) after any potential outages or significant degradation of service to transparently and openly explain to affected customers what happened, why, and the steps we are taking to prevent the problem from recurring. Note that the same Trust site is also used to communicate non-impacting scheduled events, such as regular releases. Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) : A ROM is a document managed by the Jitterbit Sales Engineering (SE) team that provides a high-level scope of the cost of services attached to a prospect\u2019s project. A ROM is an 80/20 approach to scoping and sizing Jitterbit implementations. It lacks the precision of detailed scoping but offers speed and a path to closing a deal quickly. A ROM looks at the factors that most impact the time and effort associated with particular use cases, including these: Application endpoint Batch or near real time One way or bi-directional Data volumes (1,000s, 10,000s, or >500,000) Data quality (high, medium, or low) Objects involved (price book, accounts, contacts)","title":"Jitterbit Messaging Terminology"},{"location":"glossary/#jitterbit-integration-personas","text":"API Consumer : Jitterbit customers' internal and external users who use the Portals within the Jitterbit Harmony API Manager: Internal API Consumer : A Jitterbit direct customer or a user authorized by the Jitterbit customer (e.g., Jitterbit customer employees or contractors).

This platform is known as the Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform . The Harmony Portal is the web-based interface where customers access Harmony applications, including API Manager , Citizen Integrator , Data Loader , Management Console , and Studio #zcr99mk3n8ma. The Jitterbit Harmony Portal is accessible at login.jitterbit.com. After logging in, the resulting page with the four app cards is called the Harmony Portal landing page. The Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform is powered by Jitterbit iPaaS capabilities and consists of these components: Harmony Agents : Harmony Agents do the work at runtime, such as connecting to various endpoint systems, transforming data, etc. Harmony customers can use two types of agents, Cloud Agents (serverless agents) and Private Agents (formerly Local Agents), which can be grouped together in Agent Groups to provide for high availability (active/active) and load balancing of operations across those agents. Cloud Agents : Cloud Agents are hosted by Jitterbit directly and perform all of their work in an event-driven fashion, thereby obviating the need for any setup, configuration, or management that is traditional with \u201calways on\u201d server systems that sit behind applications. Jitterbit Cloud Agents are serverless agents, completely scalable, and ensure that all tasks are allocated and executed in a secure and reliable manner. Cloud Agents are organized into Cloud Agent Groups A Jitterbit Cloud Agent Group consists of a set of Jitterbit Harmony Agents maintained and managed by Jitterbit. This option allows you to run all of your integrations in the cloud with a scalable, multi-tenant, fault-tolerant clustered Agent Group. Two Cloud Agent Groups are available: Production Cloud Agent Group : This group is available with a version of the Jitterbit Harmony Agent that is fully tested and ready for production. Sandbox Cloud Agent Group : This group is always the next version of the Jitterbit Harmony Agent, to which the Production Cloud Agent Group will next be upgraded. Typically, it is the version of the Private Agent included in the latest Harmony Platform release at time of the Sandbox Cloud Agent Group update. Private Agents (formerly Local Agents) : Private Agentsare available as traditional installation packages for various Linux and Windows flavors, and as a Docker image. They are self-hosted by customers either on-premise (i.e. in a local/private data center) or on private or public cloud of their choice, manage directly by the customer\u2019s own IT team. By using Private Agents, you choose where your integration runtime environment operates amd control which network your data travels and resides in. Private Agents are often used by customers who need applications to reside within their firewall, or for users who perform integrations under strict regulatory compliance that forbids data to either travel outside a given geographical boundary or reside in the cloud. Acceptable term variations include: Jitterbit Harmony Cloud Agent Jitterbit Harmony Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Docker Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Linux Private Agent Jitterbit Harmony Windows Private Agent Cloud Agent, Private Agent, Docker Private Agent, Linux Private Agent, Windows Private Agent Selection of the agent types determine the Harmony deployment model. Any integration project, including APIs, can be deployed with these models: Cloud (Serverless, Full Cloud, Multi-Tenant) : On the Jitterbit Harmony cloud, where the system and scale is completely managed by Jitterbit. Private (On-Premise, Local) : Either an on-premise server or in a public/private cloud, where the system is self-hosted and/or self-managed. Hybrid : In a hybrid mode, where selected portions of the system are self-managed and the remainder is fully managed by Jitterbit. Harmony API Gateway : The Harmony API Gateway provides security, throttling, and validation of any and every incoming API that users publish via Jitterbit. A gateway can also be installed locally and managed internally, or the client can choose the Cloud API Gateway to bypass having to host or control the gateway at all. Harmony Backend Services : Harmony Backend Services include a notification engine, remote private agent management, and other backend systems and services. Harmony Design Repository : The Harmony Design Repository is a secure and encrypted, centralized collection of integration metadata (projects). The Design Repository provides full automatic restore capability from the Harmony cloud and ensures all Cloud and Private Agents have the most recent version of relevant projects. Harmony Messaging Services : Harmony Messaging Services facilitate communication among various Harmony components, providing a reliable method for routing, tracking, and integration retry mechanisms across customers, projects, and means of integration. Harmony Transaction Logs : Harmony Transaction Logs provide easy debugging capabilities for troubleshooting purposes. These logs can be stored for a configurable period of time either locally or on the cloud located in your geography. The extent of information stored in the logs is configurable and can be specified on a per-event basis. Harmony Management APIs : Harmony Management APIs are Jitterbit\u2019s APIs that allow access to all of Harmony\u2019s functionality via web service calls. Any aspect of the Harmony API Integration Platform can be accessed as an API. Developers can leverage these APIs to complete many of the tasks that are typically accomplished via the Design Studio or Management Console, for example exporting Jitterbit logs to a third-party service. Harmony Management APIs are also referred to as Jitterbit Microservices. Harmony region : Jitterbit uses servers in separate regions for NA (North America) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa/Asia/Australia). The region is tied to a Harmony organization rather than a specific user. This allows a user to be part of multiple organizations in different regions.","title":"Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform"},{"location":"glossary/#related-terms","text":"Harmony region : Jitterbit uses servers in separate regions for NA (North America) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa/Asia/Australia).

These terms are used in Design Studio: Connectors : Connectors are out-of-the-box Jitterbit products that provide pre-built and reusable connectivity to a specific endpoint, such as Salesforce or NetSuite. Connectors provide a flattened interface to reduce the complexity of interacting directly with an endpoint\u2019s API or data exchange protocols. Connectors are used to take the guesswork out of vendor APIs for faster and easier mapping and integration design. Formula Builder : The Formula Builder is used to enter scripts to enhance and refine your wizard-created data processes. Also see the definition for scripts . Hosted HTTP Endpoints : Hosted HTTP Endpoints are project items that enable operations to be triggered via a URL pointed directly at a particular local server. Hosted HTTP Endpoints are not secured, provide limited visibility and management, do not have built-in load balancing or high availability, and are able to be used only with a Private Agent running the operations. Hosted HTTP Endpoints are deprecated and it is recommended instead to use Jitterbit\u2019s Harmony API Integration Platform. Jitterbit Connect Wizards : Jitterbit Connect Wizards provide a fast, easy route to data transformation through a wizard-based integration tool built directly into Jitterbit. The wizard creates for the user all of the complex, detailed operations and components of a transformation. By stepping through the wizard, users can create an integration project without the need for coding. Jitterbit Connect Salesforce Wizards Jitterbit Connect Standard Wizards Jitterbit Entities : Jitterbit Entities are virtual objects that can be created to describe a structure similar to that of a database table with columns. After the Jitterbit Entity is created, the entity is assigned to the OData API. Jitterpak : A Jitterpak is a single file containing all metadata of a project. Jitterpaks are primarily used for easy local backup/archiving and redistribution of projects. Operations : Operations are project items used to define what your integration should do and when it should be done. There are four core Operation Activity types (Transformation, Script, Archive, and Web Service Call) and a variety of other types (Hosted Web Service, API Entity Operation [OData], XSLT Operation, Connectors). Plugins : Plugins are Jitterbit- or user-provided applications that extend native capabilities of Jitterbit. Plugins can be executed within sources or targets in an operation, or called from within scripts. Jitterbit includes a Plugin SDK to allow customers to wrap any business logic they may have already coded for and not want to reimplement in Jitterbit. Scripts : Scripts, written in the Jitterbit proprietary scripting language (Jitterbit Script) or in JavaScript, provide the flexibility and power to transform data, perform calculations, or perform logic validation beyond simple field mapping. Scripts can be used as steps in an operation or within transformations to apply specified logic or conditions to your data. Source : A source defines properties of the system that Jitterbit connects to and retrieves data from. The system properties vary depending on the type of source you choose. Target : A target defines the properties of the system that Jitterbit needs to connect and post data to. The system properties vary depending on the type of target you choose. Transformation : A transformation refers to the transformation and mapping of data between a source and a target system. Depending on the source and target system selected, the transformation wizard takes the user through a set of steps to define the information required to perform the transformation. Data structures representing both source and target systems are presented in graphical tree structures. Variables : Variables are used to allow for the dynamic configuration of endpoints, to support passing of data between operations, and to enable sophisticated integration logic within transformation scripts.","title":"Jitterbit Harmony Studio"},{"location":"glossary/#jitterbit-harmony-api-manager","text":"Jitterbit Harmony API Manager is Jitterbit\u2019s API management web interface where you can create and publish developer-friendly APIs and perform full API lifecycle management tasks. The general industry term API management, often abbreviated APIM, refers to API management in general. Do not use this acronym to refer to Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager web interface. Always refer to API Manager spelled out fully. Other terms used in API Manager include: API : An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of objects, instructions, methods, and standards that allows one software application to talk to another via web services. For example, when using mobile apps, an API is used to request information from a web-based software application and return the information back to your device. Jitterbit differentiates by enabling users to expose any system as a secure, managed, real-time web (e.g. REST, SOAP, custom, OData) API that can be called and consumed by any other apps. This helps eliminate siloed technology, processes, and people, and enable seamless collaboration across departments, divisions, and teams. API Analytics/Logs : Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager provides predefined and customizable dashboards and reports for user-/application-based consumption and performance including hits per hour, response times per hour, and status code per hour. APIs to pull this data are also available. API Authentication Profiles : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, profiles can be set for Anonymous (no username or password required), Basic Authentication (standard login/password and/or key), or OAuth 2.0 using Google as the Identity Provider (requires membership in authorized domains, a Google Client ID, and a Google Client Secret to be validated to access the API at runtime). Additional security settings for rate limiting, logging/auditing, and trusted IP range limiting are also provided within the profile. API Creation : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, Harmony customers can create Jitterbit APIs leveraging existing integration operations. These Jitterbit APIs are created following REST design practices to provide accessible and consumable APIs for both internal and external developers. Each API is assigned a unique, secure URI/URL and each method (GET, POST, etc.) under it is assigned to a single integration operation. As opposed to the outdated, slow waterfall approach in designing APIs (often confusingly referred to as design-first or design-led APIs), Jitterbit believes in the API creation process, where APIs are created on the fly and can be integrated quickly through agile development process. API Debug Mode : Using Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, debug mode enables full tracing for every request received via an API URL. When enabled, the system retains complete content of each API request and response for up to 24 hours from the time the API call was received and applies to all of the operations triggered by the API. API Gateway : Jitterbit\u2019s API Gateway receives API requests, passes the requests to the Jitterbit Agent and/or backend application, and then passes the response back to the requesting app as needed. The gateway provides authentication, security, throttling, analytics, and validation of any and every API. Our gateway is capable of leveraging Harmony\u2019s integration and transformation engine with the ability to access virtually any backend software and modify the request/response. There are two gateway options: the Jitterbit Cloud Gateway hosted by Jitterbit (backed by AWS), or your own Jitterbit Private Gateway that is installed locally on hardware behind your firewall. API Governance : API governance includes tracking what APIs are deployed, who is calling what APIs, statistics (about APIs, API consumers, and the Developer Portal), what policies should be applied, API versioning, etc. API Management (APIM) : API management includes the tools to create and publish web APIs, an API gateway to receive/process requests, a developer portal to consume APIs, and full API governance. API management is a general industry term, and its acronym (APIM) should not be used to refer to Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager web interface. API Rate Limit : The licensing associated with Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager enforces an overall maximum number of hits across all APIs under the particular organization (client/customer). A separate API rate limit may also be set at the profile- and/or environment-level, enforcing a maximum number of hits that this particular profile can make against all APIs assigned to the profile during a period of one minute. Profile-level rate limiting can effectively be used as user-based rate limiting. Developer Portal : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, Developer Portal is labeled as \u201cPortal.\u201d Portal Manager : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, the Portal Manager provides automatically generated OpenAPI documentation allowing the API developer (API Publisher persona) to manage and publish Custom APIs. Portal : Within Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager, the Portal provides internal and external developers (API Consumer persona) access to discover, learn about, interact with, and consume published APIs from a central portal. The API Manager includes the ability to invite API developers/consumers to the Portal (similar to inviting customers to Harmony EiPaaS). This provides security/access control via standard user roles such as internal developers and external developers (customers, partners, vendors, etc.). Jitterbit API : A Jitterbit API is an API created on the Harmony API Integration Platform. In addition to the common use cases for APIs, a Jitterbit API can also be used as a proxy for apps, mobile devices, and websites. Jitterbit APIs are custom-built, showcasing the flexibility of our platform. That is, you can build a secure API by using the EiPaaS platform to bring together disparate systems (legacy apps, databases, SaaS, and Cloud apps) that meet your specific business goals as well as match whatever structure and standard you require; therefore, the API is custom-made for your specific needs. OpenAPI 2.0 API Documentation : Using the Jitterbit API Manager, the request and response structures for each Custom API are automatically generated and exposed via the OpenAPI 2.0 (formerly known as Swagger) format within the Developer Portal at the time the API is published. Using the Developer Portal, the documentation may be edited or enhanced by the publisher to provide additional information to internal and external API consumers. (Note: The auto-generation of OpenAPI docs is not available for OData services at this time.) OpenAPI Specification : The Jitterbit API Manager includes the ability to auto-document published Custom APIs using OpenAPI 2.0 in the Portal Manager. Formerly known as Swagger, the OpenAPI Spec is a documentation specification for REST APIs. Open Data (OData) Protocol : OData is an open protocol that allows the creation and consumption of REST APIs in a simple and standard way. Jitterbit\u2019s API Manager provides the ability to create an OData 2.0 API by assigning a URL to a Jitterbit Entity operation. Certain types of Jitterbit Entities, such as SAP, support read only (GET). Real-time/Evented vs. Near Real-time : Real-time/evented refers to processing the data/request as it comes in, typically without buffer delays, with a response expected to be received within milliseconds or sometimes microseconds. Near real-time refers to the time delay introduced by automated data processing or network transmission between the request and the response.","title":"Jitterbit Harmony API Manager"},{"location":"glossary/#jitterbit-harmony-citizen-integrator","text":"Jitterbit Harmony Citizen Integrator is Jitterbit\u2019s click-and-run web application for non-technical users to quickly customize and deploy integrations using pre-built recipes. The acronym CI should not be used to reference Citizen Integrator. Always use the full term, Citizen Integrator. Jitterbit differentiates our Citizen Integrator product by offering fully-tested recipes that are certified to work on their respective endpoints, in addition to crowd-sourced models. Our certified recipes are canonical versions that use a common \u201cMaster\u201d object model (such as an Account Master, Contact Master, or Product Master) and all endpoints are mapped to the canonical Master. It is easy to take a partial recipe and plug it into the Master, knowing it will automatically work, which saves over 50% of the time of having to perform an end-to-end transformation and mapping for an endpoint. Citizen Integrator includes these capabilities: An interface for recipe designers to create and deploy recipes for their end-users and customers. True no-code, conversational user experience, which leads end-users through a question-based, step-by-step configuration and deployment of recipes.

Ability to share recipes with specific users or groups. Other terms used in Citizen Integrator include: Citizen Integrator Persona : See the definition under Jitterbit Integration Personas . Recipe : A recipe is a reusable integration template in Citizen Integrator that provides a step-by-step guided experience for non-technical users to execute an integration. Recipes can also be downloaded as Jitterpaks and imported into Design Studio. Templates : Templates are pre-built mappings and workflows for a specific integration need between endpoints. Templates provide a jump start to the integration project so that you don\u2019t have to build everything from scratch. Templates provide the most common field mappings and use cases that most customers need. Installing the template alone will give you a baseline integration between the two systems, for example to synchronize Contacts between Salesforce and NetSuite. However, many businesses have custom fields and unique needs that might require some customizations after the template is installed. For example, your business might want to synchronize a custom Contact field (Nickname) between NetSuite and Salesforce. Note that Jitterpaks are not implicitly considered to be templates, and templates are not considered to be recipes.","title":"Jitterbit Harmony Citizen Integrator"},{"location":"glossary/#jitterbit-harmony-management-console","text":"Jitterbit Harmony Management Console is Jitterbit\u2019s web console where you can manage your integration projects and perform administrative functions related to your organization.

The Jitterbit user documentation set includes step-by-step instructions, conceptual content, enablement information, references, troubleshooting pages, use cases, and product tutorials. Every page and every topic must have a clear focus on the user. By providing relevant information that guides a reader through a process or goal, our documents help users become productive and confident when they use our software and services. To support this goal, Jitterbit documentation follows these principles: Focus on the user, not on the product or a feature. Include only the information a user needs to accomplish their goal. Write in direct, plain language. Include clear, complete, and rich examples that help users understand complicated concepts or complex procedures. User-focused Readers look for content that applies to their situation, so Jitterbit documents avoid describing what the product or UI does and instead focus on what the user can do . Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents user-focused: Consider assumptions about the audience's knowledge level. Write documentation at the level of understanding the user has, but don't assume that terms and concepts are commonplace. Construct sentences that explain what the user can do with the product, not what the product lets the user do . Consider the user's reason for using the documentation and focus the documentation on their goal rather than detailing every aspect of what engineering built. Goal-oriented As proud and excited as we are about the capabilities of Jitterbit, readers are more interested in achieving a goal. We show a user how to complete goals and solve real-world problems. Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents goal-oriented: Identify the audience and know their needs before planning content. Describe prerequisites and background or other information about the feature that a user needs to achieve their goal. Include just the information that offers value to the user in achieving what they set out to do. Link thoughtfully to supporting material or additional information. Straightforward Users don't read a documentation from start to finish. They look titles and keywords matching their problem or question, and then they scan the content for information or examples. Jitterbit documentation has descriptive titles and tasks written in straightforward, plain language. Apply the following guidelines to help keep our documentation straightforward: Title your topics and section headings so that users can find the information they need. Write directly to the user and in plain language. Avoid unnecessary technical language. Don't use jargon. Remember that people all around the world read and depend on our documents. Their experience with English varies. For more information about writing in Jitterbit tone, see Tone . For help on topic titles, see ManuDocument Names, Topic Titles, and Section Headings .

The goal is to improve Jitterbit documentation by showing you where and why consistency is important across documents and web sites. Of course, there are times where it might make sense to move away from these guidelines to make your documentation better. It's most important that you strive for clear, high-quality documentation than to blindly follow this guide.

We may incorporate your changes into this guide. Who We Are The Jitterbit Writing Style Guide is researched, written, and produced by the Documentation Group here at Jitterbit. We've reached out to other stakeholders here at Jitterbit, including Product, Engineering, Support, and others for input and advice.

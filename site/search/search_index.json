Best practices All images \u2014 screenshot, diagram, GIF, or inline image \u2014 must have alt text. For inline images, GIFs, and complex diagrams, include adequate surrounding text so you don't place too much information in the alt-text . Surrounding text For an inline image, write the name or a description of the icon in the sentence. Put the icon inparentheses immediately after that text. For a complex diagram, use lines of surrounding text to explain the diagram. You can include a simple sentence in the alt-text that refers to this descriptive text.

For complex images, place the most important information about the image in the first sentence of alt text.

Make content accessible for all audiences, with or without disabilities. Use these guidelines when creating content. Writing Use plain language, simple sentence construction, and short paragraphs. Complex sentences and long paragraphs can be a real struggle for some users. Plain language makes a smoother, better experience. Consider that some readers use screen readers or other assistive devices. Avoid using complex words and avoid technical jargon or complicated technological terms. If you must use technological terms, be consistent. Use Plain Language offers guidance. Avoid language that relise on spatial direction Spatial directional language doesn't help users with screen readers. Instead of using above , below , left , or right to direct users, use earlier , later , or following . Likewise, avoid relying only on visual language, such as text referring to color, shape, and patterns. Refer to UI elements using their labels whenever possible, and don't rely on directional or visual language as the only means to guide users to a location. Lead into new page elements such as tables, lists, images, videos, searches, commands, and code blocks. Introduce a new page element with a lead-in sentence that explains what information the element contains or what the user needs to do. These lead-in sentences can prepare users for what to expect. Spell it out Avoid unnecessary abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms Spell out words like and , plus , minus , and approximately instead of using symbols. See Abbreviations and Acronyms and Initialisms . Consult the Usage Dictionary . Be precise and exact Make sure that the noun that a pronoun refers to us clear.

The following table contains examples of vague sentences and more precise alternatives: Vague This leads to an invalid activity. This is similar to JavaScript, with with important differences. Precise Undefined variables lead to an invalid activity. Jitterbit Script is similar to JavaScript, with important differences. Titles and Document and Section Headings Headings help break up long text passages and help all readers navigate through a page. Descriptive titles and headings are not only useful for search engine optimization, but also help all users find information. Many sighted and screen reader users scan through headings first to figure out where they need to go. Sections organized by headings are easier to parse than long sections with fewer headings. Make your headings descripted and well-organized. It makes it much easier for our users to understand the documentation. Organize your topic using headers down to the H3 level. If you need to use a heading level beyond an H3, your topic might be too complex. Never skip heading hierarchy levels. For more guidance on headings, see Manual names, topic titles, and section headings. Images and Figures Images can help readers understand complex topics, locate an icon, or zero in on a portion of the UI. However, don't include images without alt-text or surrounding test with limited vision. Ask yourself, Does this image help understand the text? Have I included alt-text for screen readers? . Alt-text is crucial for helping visually impaired users understand and use our sofware and services. Some users aren't native English speakers and use translation tools to translate alt-text for images with accompanying English labels. Here are some tips for using image: Don't include new information in an image. Introduce new information in the surrounding text of the image. Don't rely on color to convey the message of the image. Use a combination of colors, shapes, patterns, explanatory text, and labels instead. Ensure your image meets the contrast ratio for users with visual disabilities. See https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ on the WebAIM website. Always include alt text. For guidance on writing alt text, see Include alt text.

The Jitterbit user documentation set includes step-by-step instructions, conceptual content, enablement information, references, troubleshooting pages, use cases, and product tutorials. Every page, every topic must have a clear focus on the user. By providing relevant information that guides a reader through a process or goal, Jitterbit documents help users become productive and confident when they use our software and services. To support this goal, Jitterbit documentation follows these principles: Focus on the user, not on the product or a feature. Include only the information a user needs to accomplish their goal. Write in direct, plain language. Include clear, complete, rich examples that help users understand complicated concepts or complex procedures. User-focused Readers look for content that applies to their situation, so Jitterbit documents avoid describing what the product or UI does and instead focus on what the user can do . Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents user-focused: Consider assumptions about the audience's knowledge level. Write documentation at the level of understanding the user has, but don't assume that terms and concepts are commonplace. Construct sentences that explain what the user can do with the product, not what the product lets the user do . Consider the user's reason for using the documentation and focus the documentation on their goal rather than detailing every aspect of what engineering built. Goal-oriented Readers have more interest in achieving a goal than reading about the capabilities of Jitterbit. We show a user how to complete goals and solve real-world problems. Apply the following guidelines to help keep Jitterbit documents goal-oriented: Identify the audience and know their needs before planning content.

Include just the information that offers value to the user in achieving what they set out to do. Link thoughtfully to supporting material or additional information.
